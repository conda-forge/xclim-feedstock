  summary: 'Library of derived climate variables, ie climate indicators, based on xarray'
  description: |
    xclim is a library of functions computing climate indices. It is based on xarray 
    and can benefit from the parallelization provided by dask. Its objective is to
    make it as simple as possible for users to compute indices from large climate 
    datasets, and for scientists to write new indices with very little boilerplate.
